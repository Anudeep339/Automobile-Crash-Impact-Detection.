For this project Arduino Nano is used.
For more information refer Connection.png image.

Force Sensitive Resistor:
	Pin1 -> Resistor -> Gnd pin
	Pin1 -> A0 pin
	Pin2 -> +5V pin

Collision Sensor:
	Vcc -> +5V Pin
	Gnd -> Gnd Pin
	Out -> D7 Pin

After making all the above connections burn the collision_fsr Arduino code into Arduino Nano.
